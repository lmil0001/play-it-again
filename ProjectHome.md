## **Play It Again** ##

### Project Summary ###
The digital future has a history and it needs remembering. Vital human and technical data is in danger of being lost. In the 1980s, the Australian and New Zealand software industries were remarkably active in the production of digital games and yet little is known about this chapter in the history of the moving image.

In collaboration with the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) and other institutional partners, the **Play it Again project** will:
  * address the need for institutional collecting and preservation solutions;
  * document and preserve the histories of early games and gaming cultures; and
  * create software tools to facilitate both the playing of early games now, and the delivery of benefits to research, industry and community into the future.
